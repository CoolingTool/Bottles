will port to discordia 3.0

this bot is very early development so i dont know why you are here or how you got here

im not giving out the invite yet 

# install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/CoolingTool/Bottles -b dia3.0
cd Bottles
lit install
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lzubiaur/ini.lua/master/ini.lua -o deps/ini.lua
```
then copy the `.conf.example` file to `.conf` and change the values accordingly

> it accepts environment variables (prefixed with $) for support with replit secrets

# windows 

probably will work on windows since luvit is cross platform but i havent tested
